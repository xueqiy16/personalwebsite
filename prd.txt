# Refined PRD: Monument Valley-Inspired Personal Portfolio

## 1. Vision and Concept

A **3D isometric interactive portfolio website** inspired by the visual language of *Monument Valley*. The world is bright, sunny, and rendered in a **classic Monument Valley palette** (terracotta, teal, warm orange, dusty pink). The scene consists of a central architectural monument where:

- The **top / center** of the monument houses an **About Me** section with bio and contact links.
- Two distinct **doors / portals** on the monument lead to the main content areas:
  - **Door A -- "My Beloved Arts"**: branches into Dance, Rhythmic Gymnastics, and Music.
  - **Door B -- "My Projects"**: branches into Articles (Medium), X Posts, and Past Projects.

The site will launch with **placeholder content** across all sections, to be replaced with real content over time.

## 3. Architecture and Scene Graph

### 3.1 Isometric Camera

- `OrthographicCamera` at a fixed position (e.g. `[10, 10, 10]`) looking at `[0, 0, 0]`.
- On mobile: same 3D experience with camera zoomed out to fit the full monument on smaller viewports.

### 3.2 World Grid

- All architectural geometry follows a strict unit grid (1 unit = 1 block).
- Low-poly geometry only: boxes, cylinders, arches, stairs. No imported high-poly models.

### 3.3 Scene Graph Hierarchy

## 4. User Flow

### 4.1 Landing Experience

1. User arrives at the site and sees a **splash screen** displaying your name / logo.
2. Splash fades out and the 3D monument is revealed (camera is already in its default isometric position). A young girl is standing in the center.
3. Background ambient music begins (with a mute/unmute toggle visible).

### 4.2 Main View (Monument)

- The full monument is visible in isometric perspective. There is a beautiful waterfall running down from the monument, with Calgary rocky mountains in the background and beautiful trees and flowers growing along the monument walls.
- Two interactive doors glow subtly or have visual affordances (e.g. floating labels, slight animation).
- The **top of the monument** has a small interactive zone for "About Me."
- Hovering a door: mesh scales up slightly or emits a glow. Subtle hover SFX plays.
- Clicking a door: The child walks to the door. GSAP-driven camera zoom/pan to focus on that door area.

### 4.3 Sub-Section View

- After zooming into a door, a **2D overlay** (animated in with Framer Motion) presents the sub-section choices:
  - Door A: three paths -- Dance, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Music.
  - Door B: three paths -- Articles, X Posts, Projects.
- Clicking a path opens the **content overlay** for that sub-section.

### 4.4 Content Overlays

| Sub-Section | Content Format |
|------------|---------------|
| **Dance** | Mix of embedded videos, photo galleries, and text descriptions |
| **Rhythmic Gymnastics** | Mix of embedded videos, photo galleries, and text descriptions |
| **Music** | Mix of embedded videos, photo galleries, and text descriptions |
| **Articles** | Cards with title, date, thumbnail, and "Read on Medium" button (external links) |
| **X Posts** | Embedded X/Twitter posts (using Twitter embed API) |
| **Past Projects** | Cards with thumbnail image (more detail fields like description, links can be added later) |

### 4.5 About Me (Top of Monument)

- Clicking the top/center zone of the monument opens an overlay with:
  - Bio / personal introduction text.
  - Contact information and social links (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, email, X).

### 4.6 Back Navigation

- A visible **"Back" or "X" button** appears on any overlay.
- Clicking it closes the overlay (Framer Motion exit animation) and triggers a GSAP camera transition back to the default isometric view.
- Child walks back to the center of the monument.
- Navigation follows a simple stack: Main View -> Door View -> Content View, and "Back" pops one level.

## 5. Visual Aesthetic

### 5.1 Color Palette (Monument Valley Classic)

- **Primary surfaces**: Terracotta / warm orange (`#C2703E`, `#E8A87C`)
- **Accent / secondary**: Teal (`#41B3A3`)
- **Highlights**: Dusty pink (`#D4A5A5`)
- **Background / sky**: Soft warm gradient or flat warm cream (`#FDF6EC`)
- *Exact hex values are starting points -- to be refined during implementation.*

### 5.2 Lighting

- Single `DirectionalLight` (high intensity, casting soft shadows).
- `AmbientLight` for fill.
- No textures; flat-shaded `MeshStandardMaterial` or `MeshLambertMaterial` with the pastel palette.

### 5.3 Geometry Style

- Clean primitives: boxes, arches, stairs, cylinders.
- All low-poly for performance.
- Strict grid alignment.

---

## 6. Audio

- **Background music**: Soft ambient instrumental music track that loops. Starts on site load after splash.
- **Interaction SFX**: Subtle sounds on hover and click (door interactions, button clicks, transitions).
- **Mute/unmute toggle**: Always visible in a corner of the screen.
- Audio files will be placeholder/royalty-free to start.

---

## 7. Responsive Design (Mobile)

- **Full 3D experience preserved on mobile** -- no 2D fallback.
- Camera zoom adjusted (zoomed out further) so the full monument fits on smaller screens.
- Touch events mapped to click events for door interactions.
- UI overlays are responsive via Tailwind CSS (stacked layouts, adjusted font sizes).
- Performance: keep geometry minimal, test on mid-range devices.

---

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Initialize Next.js 15 App Router project with Tailwind CSS.
- Install dependencies: `three`, `@types/three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `gsap`, `framer-motion`, `zustand`, `howler`.
- Set up the `Canvas` with `OrthographicCamera` in isometric position.
- Create Zustand store for navigation state and audio state.

### Phase 2: Monument Construction

- Build the isometric monument geometry using drei primitives (`Box`, `Cylinder`, etc.).
- Apply the Monument Valley color palette with flat-shaded materials.
- Set up lighting (DirectionalLight + AmbientLight).
- Set the background sky color/gradient.

### Phase 3: Splash Screen

- Create splash screen component (with my name: Xueqi Yang, fade animation).
- Implement transition from splash to main 3D view.

### Phase 4: Interactive Doors and Navigation

- Create the `Portal` component (hover glow/scale, click handler).
- Place two door portals and one "About Me" zone on the monument.
- Implement GSAP camera transitions (zoom into door, return to default).
- Add the "Back" button with return-to-default behavior.

### Phase 5: Content Overlays

- Build the overlay system with Framer Motion enter/exit animations.
- Create sub-section selector view (3 paths per door).
- Build content card components for each sub-section type:
  - Media cards (video embeds, photos, text) for Arts.
  - Medium article cards with external links.
  - Embedded X/Twitter posts.
  - Project thumbnail cards.
- Build the About Me overlay (bio + social links).
- Populate all sections with placeholder content.

### Phase 6: Audio

- Integrate Howler.js for background music and SFX.
- Add mute/unmute toggle UI.
- Wire up interaction SFX to hover/click events.

### Phase 7: Polish and Responsive

- Test and adjust mobile camera positioning.
- Ensure all overlays are responsive.
- Performance optimization (geometry, lazy loading, etc.).
- Deploy to Vercel.

## 9. Key Constraints and Success Criteria

- **Performance**: All 3D geometry must be low-poly. Target 60fps on desktop, 30fps+ on mobile.
- **No textures**: Flat colors only, matching the Monument Valley aesthetic.
- **Accessibility**: All interactive elements must have clear visual affordances. Overlays should be keyboard-navigable.
- **State management**: Zustand store tracks current view, navigation history, and audio on/off.
- **Placeholder-first**: Ship with placeholder content; real content will be swapped in iteratively.
